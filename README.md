# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, most of the code was structured after classwork 'Student GeoJSON' activity in week 15 activity 10. I also looked at acitivity 4 'School District Choropleth.' The legend code was from the Leaflet Documentation on Interactive Choropleth Map and I also looked at the Using GeoJSON with Leaflet documentation to help with the circle markers.  I asked XPERT learning assistant for help with why my markers weren't displaying at first and it helped restructure my code with some corrections.
